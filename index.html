                                    On the first day of my internship journey, a mix of nervousness and genuine excitement washed over me as we walked through the halls of DepEd Sorsogon. We received a brief orientation regarding the rules and a walkthrough of the building from Ma'am Laarne, our OJT coordinator.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p class="text-primary-dark leading-relaxed">
                                    Afterwards, we were assigned to our respective departments. We were divided into pairs, and I was partnered with Arjelone. Together, we were assigned to the Accounting Office. As we arrived, the office was very busy, but when Ma'am Laarne introduced us as the new OJTs, everyone greeted us with a warm welcome.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p class="text-primary-dark leading-relaxed">
                                    Sir Paul Andy, the head of the department, welcomed us and gave a brief explanation of the workloads that would be assigned to us. His assistant, Sir Eiman, then showed us our workspace cubicle and introduced us to Ma'am Dothy, who instructed us on our very first task: encoding liquidation reports from different municipalities of Sorsogon.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p class="text-primary-dark leading-relaxed">
                                    By the end of the day, we had accomplished 75 liquidation reports from Juban. The day was filled with introductions and new faces, and I realized that stepping out of the classroom and becoming an intern at DepEd Sorsogon allowed me to see how things truly work in the real world.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p class="text-primary-dark leading-relaxed">
                                    On our second day, we attended the first mass of August. After that, we were assigned a new task: writing liquidation reports for the months of April to July. By the end of the day, I had completed 100 files. Although my hands felt numb from all the writing, the task was still enjoyable and manageable since it only required writing the school name and corresponding month.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p class="text-primary-dark leading-relaxed">
                                    In the following days, our tasks remained the same encoding and writing liquidation reports. Since our workspace had only one computer, Arjie and I scheduled our tasks accordingly. When I was encoding reports, Arjie focused on writing, and after lunch, we switched roles to balance the workload.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p class="text-primary-dark leading-relaxed">
                                    As the first week came to an end, I realized how valuable the experience had become. The routine taught me patience and teamwork, while also giving me insight into real office dynamics sharing responsibilities, adapting to limited resources, and supporting one another. Week one was both challenging and fulfilling, strengthening my excitement for the rest of my internship journey.
                                </p>

                                    As week two of my internship journey began, I felt more confident and comfortable in my role. 
                                    The nervousness of the first few days had slowly faded, replaced with a growing sense of familiarity 
                                    with the tasks and the people around me.
                                </p>

                                    The same tasks were given to us either encoding or writing liquidation reports from different 
                                    municipalities. Each day, we consistently accomplished one sack of files, which was equivalent 
                                    to 100 reports.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p class="text-primary-dark leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                    In the following days, the routine became smoother as I grew more accustomed to the workload. 
                                    Although repetitive, the tasks taught me the importance of accuracy, consistency, and time management.
                                </p>

                                    By the end of the second week, I realized that internships are not only about learning technical 
                                    skills but also about building discipline and resilience. The daily accomplishment of 100 files 
                                    was proof of our dedication and effort. Week two gave me a deeper appreciation of the value of hard work, 
                                    and it motivated me to look forward to the challenges and lessons that the coming weeks would bring.

                                    As week three of my internship journey began, Ma'am Noreen gave us a new task: preparing the payroll 
                                    for transportation and meal allowances of division test monitors, which had to be finished before the 
                                    week of September. The real challenge began when Sir Carlo also gave us another set of liquidation 
                                    reports that needed to be encoded. Since we only had one computer, Arjie and I decided to divide the 
                                    work while I focused on Ma'am Noreen's task, she worked on Sir Carlo's. After every twenty items 
                                    we accomplished, we swapped tasks so that each of us could also work on the other assignment.

                                    At first, the task was difficult because I had to search for amounts across different files. However, 
                                    as the days passed, I became familiar with the documents, and the process gradually became easier. 
                                    By the end of the week, I managed to complete all the files assigned to me.
                                </p>

                                    Week three was a challenge. Balancing two major tasks with limited resources was not easy, but it 
                                    taught me the importance of teamwork and resourcefulness. What seemed overwhelming at first became 
                                    manageable through practice and cooperation. Completing all the files within the week gave me a sense 
                                    of accomplishment and reminded me that challenges are opportunities to grow stronger and more capable.

                                    working on the tracking slip and payroll salary. It was an easy task since I only needed to find 
                                    and copy the check number from each slip, but I also had to be very careful in copying the numbers 
                                    because they were important and needed to be accurate.

                                    As week five of my internship journey began, it was already the month of September. We were so happy 
                                    to receive a t-shirt from DepEd, which was given to us to be worn during the first mass of the month. 
                                    Along with the mass, we also celebrated the opening ceremony of National Teachers' Month. It was a new 
                                    experience for me, and I was very glad to be able to attend such a meaningful event.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p class="text-primary-dark leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                    In the following days, we were given the same tasks encoding liquidation reports for Senior High per 
                                    month and preparing reports for the feeding program. Despite the repetitive nature of the work, we 
                                    consistently finished every task assigned to us.
                                </p>

                                    Week five was memorable not only because of the tasks we accomplished but also because of the experiences 
                                    outside the office, such as attending the mass and the National Teachers' Month ceremony. These moments 
                                    reminded me that being part of DepEd is more than just paperwork it is also about celebrating education 
                                    and honoring the people who dedicate their lives to it.

                                    A new chapter of my internship journey began in week six, bringing unexpected changes and adjustments. 
                                    As the week started, some changes took place unfortunately, Arjie and I were transferred to the Cash 
                                    Department because new intern students from SSU had been assigned to the Accounting Office, and their 
                                    courses were more aligned with that department. Ma'am Laarne decided to transfer us, and it was fine 
                                    since the Cash Office did not have any interns at that time.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p class="text-primary-dark leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                    On our first day there, it felt like the very first day of our internship again full of introductions, 
                                    new tasks, and skills we needed to learn. When we arrived at the Cash Office, Ma'am Rica, the head of 
                                    the department, greeted us warmly and was very happy to have us there. Her kindness helped ease our 
                                    nervousness. We greeted them back and introduced ourselves.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p class="text-primary-dark leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                    As the days passed, we slowly learned how the Cash Office operates. Ma'am Amy was the one assigning 
                                    us tasks and orienting us on what to do, such as assisting clients in finding their paychecks. Sir Raul 
                                    guided us on where to locate payroll files for clients who were inquiring, while Sir Jeff and Ma'am Rica 
                                    often asked us to deliver their paperwork or important files to other offices.
                                </p>

                                    Being transferred to a new department felt like starting over, but it gave me the chance to explore a 
                                    different side of office work and gain new experiences. The smaller team environment allowed us to build 
                                    closer connections with the staff, and their guidance helped us adjust quickly. This week reminded me that 
                                    every change brings opportunities to grow, and I felt more confident knowing that I could handle new 
                                    challenges with patience and determination.

                                    On the first day, I was assigned to prepare certificates for the winners of the best booths and for 
                                    the pageant participants of the DepEd Mr. and Ms. Ambassadors. At the same time, I also sorted report 
                                    files and receipts. The second day was filled with raffles and games, and I volunteered to assist the 
                                    Supply Office in distributing prizes to raffle winners. On the final day of the bazaar, we prepared both 
                                    certificates and prize money for the winners of the booth contest and the pageant.

                                    for the month. During this time, Ma'am Amy taught me how to issue receipts for clients paying for the

                                    Although the week was packed with responsibilities, it was also one of the most rewarding experiences 
                                    of my internship. Balancing event preparations with client services taught me the importance of staying 
                                    organized under pressure. By the end of the week, I felt proud of my accomplishments and more confident

                                    As week eight of my internship began, Ma'am Rica assigned us a new task: encoding the list of MOOE 
                                    and PS monitoring reports for December 2024 and for January to November 2025. To manage the workload 
                                    efficiently, Arjie and I created a schedule. In the mornings, I focused on encoding while she handled 
                                    other responsibilities such as delivering files to the SDS office, sorting documents, and assisting clients. 
                                    In the afternoons, we switched roles so that she could continue the encoding while I took care of the remaining tasks.
